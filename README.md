# AI Technical Test

Welcome!  This repository contains my solutions for the technical AI challenge. 

---

##  Overview

The notebook is structured to reflect both problem-solving and reasoning. 

The solutions are explained progressively. Thought processes are discussed inline in markdown cells before or after each implementation.

---

## Thought Process

Before implementing most of the tasks, I reflected on:

- **The underlying problem**.
- **How to evaluate effectiveness**.
- **Design trade-offs**.

- This reasoning is documented throughout the notebook, as small "discussions" before/after code.
---

##  Structure

- Tasks are ordered **from implementation to design to experience**.
- Any unsolved or pending questions (e.g., due to lack of external access or runtime limits) are placed at the **end of the notebook** for transparency.
- Task **16**'s final markdown file was generated with ChatGPT, but the **content elaboration and ideas were mine**. I just wanted a clean polish. ðŸ˜‰

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook: `Carbon_Jar_AI_Technical_Test.ipynb`.
2. Read top to bottom. Code and explanations are embedded.
3. For each major question, markdown cells guide the reasoning.
4. The last section contains anything incomplete or awaiting refinement.

## Final Words

Thanks for the opportunity! This test was engaging and well-balanced between engineering and critical thinking. If you'd like more clarification or an API-based version of any component, happy to provide.

Best Regards,
