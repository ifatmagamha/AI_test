# Model Card: EmissionPredictor

## Model Details

**Model Name:** EmissionPredictor  
**Model Type:** Supervised Regression  
**Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor (`sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** [Your Name or Organization]  
**Date Created:** [Insert Date]

The `EmissionPredictor` is a machine learning model that uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict emission-related target values based on a set of input features. It is implemented as a Python class that encapsulates training and prediction logic using `scikit-learn`.

## Intended Use

This model is intended for:
- Estimating emission levels (e.g., CO₂, NOx) based on technical or environmental input data.
- Supporting decision-making in environmental impact studies, policy formulation, or regulatory compliance.

**Not intended for:**
- Real-time or safety-critical applications.
- Use on data significantly different from the training distribution without additional validation.

---

## Training Data

The model is trained using tabular data with:
- **Features (X):** A DataFrame of input variables (e.g., fuel type, engine size, manufacturing year).
- **Target (y):** A numeric variable representing the emission level.

Note: The quality and representativeness of the training data directly influence the model's accuracy and generalizability.

---

## Evaluation Data

The model should be evaluated on a separate, representative dataset that:
- Reflects the same distribution as the intended use case.
- Contains no data leakage from the training set.
- Includes ground truth values for emission levels.

Suggested split: 70% training / 30% testing or use of cross-validation.

## Metrics

Typical regression evaluation metrics to assess model performance:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

Choose the metric that aligns best with your use case (e.g., RMSE for penalizing larger errors).

## Ethical Considerations

- **Bias & Fairness:** If the training data is biased (e.g., overrepresents specific vehicle types or regions), the model may produce biased predictions.
- **Transparency:** The ensemble nature of Random Forests can reduce interpretability; consider using feature importance tools (e.g., SHAP).
- **Environmental Impact:** Predictions should not be used to justify non-compliance with emission regulations.

## Caveats and Recommendations

- The bias-variance tradoff
- Performance may degrade on unseen or out-of-distribution data.
- Retraining is recommended when significant changes occur in input feature distributions or regulatory standards.
